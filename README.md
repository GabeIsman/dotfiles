# This is how I do stuff
This is a more-complete by the day collection of my configuration files and tools.

### First things first

- `brew bundle install`
- Install vim following instructions in vim/README.md
- Run `install.sh` to symlink these configs to their various appropriate locations

### Setting up a new daily driver:
- Firefox
- Rectangle

- Dropbox
