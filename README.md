# This is how I do stuff
This is a semi-complete collection of my configuration files and tools.

### First things first
- [Install homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

- `brew bundle install`
- Run `install.sh` to symlink these configs to their various appropriate locations

### Setting up a new daily driver:
- Firefox
- Rectangle
- Kitty
- 1Password
- Dropbox
